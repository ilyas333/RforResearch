It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&amp;T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R. http://www.r-project.org/about.html According to Wikipedia R is a free software programming language and a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls and surveys of data miners are showing R’s popularity has increased substantially in recent years. To Summarise R is the most amazing free statistical software ever! This recent video by Revolution Analytics does a great job in summarizing R ! "],

["3-1-data-types.html", "3.1 Data Types", " 3.1 Data Types As per R’s official language definitions; in every computer language variables provide a means of accessing the data stored in memory. R does not provide direct access to the computer’s memory but rather provides a number of specialized data structures we will refer to as objects. These objects are referred to through symbols or variables. 3.1.1 Double Doubles are numbers like 5.0, 5.5, 10.999 etc. They may or may not include decimal places. Doubles are mostly used to represent a continuous variable like serial number, weight, age etc. x=8.5 is.double(x) #to check if the data type is double [1] TRUE 3.1.2 Integer Integers are natural numbers. x=9 typeof(x) [1] &quot;double&quot; #The following specifically assigns an integer to x x=as.integer(9) typeof(x) [1] &quot;integer&quot; 3.1.3 Logical A variable of data type logical has the value TRUE or FALSE. To perform calculation on logical objects in R the FALSE is replaced by a zero and TRUE is replaced by 1. x=11 y=10 a=x&gt;y a [1] TRUE typeof(a) [1] &quot;logical&quot; 3.1.4 Character Characters represent the string values in R. An object of type character can have alphanumeric strings. Character objects are specified by assigning a string or collection of characters between double quotes (“ string”) . Everything in a double quote is considered a string in R. 3.1.5 Factor -Factor is an important data type to represent categorical data. This also comes handy when dealing with Panel or Longitudinal data. Example of factors are Blood type (A , B, AB, O), Sex (Male or Female). Factor objects can be created from character object or from numeric object. -The operator c is used to create a vector of values which can be of any data type. b.type=c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;AB&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;O&quot;) #character object #use factor function to convert to factor object b.type=factor(b.type) b.type [1] A AB B O Levels: A AB B O #to get individual elements (levels) in factor object levels(b.type) [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;AB&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;O&quot; 3.1.6 Date &amp; Time -R is capable of dealing calendar dates and times. It is an important object when dealing with time series models. The function as.Date can be used to create an object of class Date. - see help(as.Date) for more details about the format of dates. date1=&quot;31-01-2012&quot; date1=as.Date(date1,&quot;%d-%m-%Y&quot;) date1 [1] &quot;2012-01-31&quot; data.class(date1) [1] &quot;Date&quot; #The date and time are internally interpreted as Double so the function typeof will return the type Double typeof(date1) [1] &quot;double&quot; "],
["3-2-data-structures-in-r.html", "3.2 Data Structures in R", " 3.2 Data Structures in R Every data analysis requires the data to be structured in a well defined way. These coherent ways to put together data forms some basic data structures in R. Every data set intended for analysis has to be imported in R environment as a data structure. R has the following basic data structures: • Vector • Matrix • Array • Data Frame • Lists 3.2.1 Vector Vectors are group of values having same data types. There can be numeric vectors, character vector and so on. Vectors are mostly used to represent a single variable in a data set. A vector is constructed using the function c. The same function c can be used to combine different vectors of same data type. vec1=c(1,2,3,4,5) vec1 [1] 1 2 3 4 5 The str function can be used to view the data structure of an object 3.2.2 Matrices A matrix is a collection of data elements arranged in a two-dimensional rectangular layout. Like vectors all the elements in a matrix are of same data type. \\(\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2\\\\ 3 &amp; 4\\\\ 5 &amp; 6 \\end{array}\\right]\\) The function \\(\\mathtt{matrix}\\) is used to create matrices in R. Note that all the elements in a matrix object are of same basic type. Lets create the matrix in the example above. m1=matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6),nrow=3,ncol=2,byrow=TRUE) #nrow-specify number of rows, #ncol-specify number of columns, #byrow-fill the matrix in rows with the data supplied m1 #print the matrix [,1] [,2] [1,] 1 2 [2,] 3 4 [3,] 5 6 A vector can be converted to matrix using \\(\\mathtt{dim}\\) function, e.g: m2=c(1,2,3,4,5,6) dim(m2)=c(3,2)#the matrix will be filled by columns m2 [,1] [,2] [1,] 1 4 [2,] 2 5 [3,] 3 6 #use dim to get the dimension (#rows and #columns) of a matrix dim(m1) [1] 3 2 ** Matrix Manipulations ** For calculations on matrices; all the mathematical functions available for vectors are applicable on a matrix. All operations are applied on each element in a matrix, e.g. m3=m1*2 # all elements will be multiplied by 2 individually m3 [,1] [,2] [1,] 2 4 [2,] 6 8 [3,] 10 12 A matrix can be multiplied with a vector as long as the length of the vector is a multiple of length of the matrix. Try different combinations of matrix and vector arithmetic to see the results and errors. Mathematical matrix operations are also available for matrices in R. For instance \\(\\mathtt{\\%*\\%}\\) is used for matrix multiplication, the matrices must agree dimensionally for matrix multiplication. Note the use of \\(\\mathtt{:}\\) operator to create a sequence. dim(m1)# 3 rows and 2 columns [1] 3 2 #create another matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns m3=matrix(c(1:6),ncol=3) m1%*%m3 [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 5 11 17 [2,] 11 25 39 [3,] 17 39 61 R facilitates various matrix specific operations. Table 1 gives most of the available functions and operators. Use \\(\\mathtt{help()}\\) or \\(\\mathtt{?}\\) followed by function name to get more details about the operators and functions. Table : Functions and operators for matrices Operator or Function Description X * Y Element-wise multiplication X %*% Y Matrix multiplication Y %o% X Outer product. XB’ crossprod(X,Y) X’Y crossprod(X) X’X t(X) Transpose diag(x) Creates diagonal matrix with elements of x in the principal diagonal diag(X) Returns a vector containing the elements of the principal diagonal diag(k) If k is a scalar, this creates a k x k identity matrix. Go figure. solve(X, b) Returns vector x in the equation b = Xx (i.e., X-1b) solve(X) Inverse of X where X is a square matrix. y=eigen(X) y$val are the eigenvalues of X y$vec are the eigenvectors of X y=svd(X) Singular value decomposition of X. R = chol(X) Choleski factorization of X. Returns the upper triangular factor, such that R’R = X. y = qr(X) QR decomposition of X. cbind(X,Y,…) Combine matrices(vectors) horizontally. Returns a matrix. rbind(X,Y,…) Combine matrices(vectors) vertically. Returns a matrix. rowMeans(X) Returns vector of row means. rowSums(X) Returns vector of row sums. colMeans(X) Returns vector of column means. colSums(X) Returns vector of column means. 3.2.3 Arrays Arrays are the generalisation of vectors and matrices. A vector in R is a one dimensional array and a matrix a two dimensional array. An array is a multiply subscripted collection of data entries of the same data type. Arrays can be constructed using the function \\(\\mathtt{array}\\), for example5 z=c(1:24)#vector of length 24 #constructing a 3 by 4 by 2 array a1=array(z,dim=c(3,4,2)) a1 , , 1 [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 1 4 7 10 [2,] 2 5 8 11 [3,] 3 6 9 12 , , 2 [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 13 16 19 22 [2,] 14 17 20 23 [3,] 15 18 21 24 Individual elements of an array are accessed by referring them by their index. This is done by giving the name of the array followed by the subscript (index) in this square bracket separated by commas. We try to access the element [1,3,1] of array a1 in the following example #element in the row 1 and column 3 in the first subset a1[1,3,1] [1] 7 Next we discuss the Data Frames which are the most convenient data structures for data analysis in R. Function \\(\\mathtt{dim}\\) can also be used to define an array by assigning dimensions to a vector.↩︎ "],
