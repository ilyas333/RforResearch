You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. "],
["2-what-is-r.html", "Chapter 2 What is R?", " Chapter 2 What is R? According to the official webpage: R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&amp;T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered under R. http://www.r-project.org/about.html According to Wikipedia R is a free software programming language and a software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls and surveys of data miners are showing R’s popularity has increased substantially in recent years. To Summarise R is the most amazing free statistical software ever! This recent video by Revolution Analytics does a great job in summarizing R ! "],

R follows a type inference1 coding structure and provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, including; Linear and non-linear modelling Univariate &amp; Multivariate Statistics Classical statistical tests Time-series analysis/ Econometrics Simulation and Modelling Datamining-classification, clustering etc. For computationally intensive tasks, C, C++, and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. R is easily extensible through functions and extensions, and the R community is noted for its active contributions in terms of packages. #Number of R Packages length(available.packages(repos = &quot;http://cran.us.r-project.org&quot;)[,1]) [1] 13633 Total 13633 packages and counting Type inference refers to the automatic deduction of the type of an expression in a programming language.↩ "],

["2-4-installing-packages.html", "2.4 Installing Packages", " 2.4 Installing Packages The easiest way to install packages is to do it via R console. The command install.packages(“package name”) installs R packages directly from internet. Other options to install various dependencies to a package can be easily specified when calling this function. A call to this function asks the user to chose a CRAN mirror at the first instance. Run the following to install Quantreg package on R. Also use the help function to get the details. #Install a package using RStudio Console install.packages(&quot;quantreg&quot;,dependencies=c(&quot;Depends&quot;,&quot;Suggests&quot;)) install.packages(c(&quot;zoo&quot;,&quot;reshape2&quot;,&quot;quantreg&quot;,&quot;e1071&quot;,&quot;foreign&quot;,&quot;psych&quot;,&quot;pastecs&quot;,&quot;ggplot2&quot;,&quot;stargazer&quot;,&quot;formatR&quot;,&quot;plm&quot;,&quot;xts&quot;,&quot;tseries&quot;,&quot;fArma&quot;), dependencies = TRUE) #to be updated You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter ??. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 3. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.2: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.2. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
